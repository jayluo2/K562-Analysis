solution 1: read the input file into memory and build an internal representation, 
so that it can be randomly accessed (inspect lines before or after the current line.
Steps:
1. enumerate all variants for the current line
2. calculate window boundaries for each variant
3. Fill the window
4. calculate the sequence for all valid variant combinations
5. report to files.


solution 2: solution 1 is a complete rewriting of the program.
solution 2 is more like a patch on the current code.
It is based on a key observation: when considering the current line w/ variant length equal to 1,
 all valid line must already
have been brought into the queue while checking all the lines whose reference positions fall into
the sliding window. This is because that any alternative alleles must have length >= 1, so all valid
variant must have been brought into the window when considering reference position which assumes that
all ref/allels have sequence length 1.
