1	# chrome: the chromesome for the reference sequence and variant sequence
2	# position: the position of the motif
3	# id: the id of the position
4	# ref: reference sequence
5	# alt: the alternative variant sequence. Now we only consider motif "DELETION"
6	# ref_seq: the 2114 reference sequence
7	# variant_seq: the 2114 variant sequence with the motif in 'ref' being deleted
8	# ref_seq_1000: the 1000-bp reference sequence at the center of 2114 ref_seq window
9	# variant_seq_1000: the 1000-bp variant sequence at the center of 2114 variant_seq window
10	# ref_count_total: the total read count (exponentiated) of the reference sequence
11	# variant_count_total: the total read count (exponentiated) of the variant sequence
12	# ref_count_profile: the per-base read counts for 1000 reference sequence at the center of 2114 'ref_seq'
