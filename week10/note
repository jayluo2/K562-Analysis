fisher-test results for transcription factors.
hypothesis test on whether target transcription factors are enriched (higher proportion)
 between peak region groups (w/ snp and w/o snp) with respect to reference transcription factors (ZNF354B, TBX18, and MGA).

Summary of results:
1. the results are surprising. since target factors are expected to roughly similarly enriched on either direction,
  e.g., more like those in TBX18, but ZNF354B and MGA are highly enriched for regions w/ snp.
  
we may explore this to further details, see meeting memo:
"Jay, Shannon, and Tao", Jul 22, 2021

2. fisher test also shows (figures not uploaded, since they are trival) that the ratio of unique target TF peak vs
  number of total peaks within region w/ and w/o snp is not statistically different.
